# 🚗 Electric Vehicle Population Analysis (Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes electric vehicle (EV) population data to uncover trends in adoption, vehicle types, electric range, and Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility.  
The dashboard was built using **Power BI Desktop** with a focus on clean data modeling, reusable DAX measures, and interactive visuals.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate **data cleaning, DAX, dashboard design, and storytelling** skills using a real-world dataset.

## 📊 Key Business Questions Answered
- How many electric vehicles are registered?
- What is the distribution between BEVs and PHEVs?
- What percentage of EVs are CAFV eligible?
- How has EV adoption changed over time?
- Which manufacturers dominate the EV market?
- What is the average and maximum electric range?

---

## 🧮 Key DAX Measures
- Total EVs
- BEV Count & BEV %
- PHEV Count
- Average Electric Range
- Max Electric Range
- CAFV Eligible Count
- CAFV Eligibility %

All measures are organized in a dedicated **Measures table** following Power BI best practices.
